**Project Purpose**
---
This weeks project taught me more functions, minimalizing code, maxamizing time efficieny and TONS of debugging. I'd say my biggest challenge was that If statements. After going through countless error codes and even having to have the instructor take time to research the issue. I now feel pretty confident writing and using them. Which made it possible for me to reach the goal/purpose of this challenge. So now not only are all the stocks seperated by their ticker type. But also give us their data and a quick percentage analysis on the return. Although this can be done just in excel. Having macros makes it easier for everyone. If new data is received now I know how to set up a button so we can quickly analyze the data again with the new data. The run time return allows me to realize flaws in my coding. Although it might work, doesnt mean its the best way to go. From my original code to the code I worte after the instructors help. I was able to cut off time which saves our computers unnecessary stress.

**Results**
---
First result we receive when running the macro is run time. The 2018 stock runs in 8.9 and 2017 runs in 8.2 miliseconds. I couldn't exactly figure out why this was, seeing how they have the same amount of rows and columns. However the overall count of 2018 is high so that might be the cause. Secondly, we notice the colors/return value. In 2017 all of the stocks are in the green except TERP. Then once we run the 2018 analysis, we see there are only two in the green. Which looking at the daily volume you might think be the cause because of their superiority in this matter. But even SPWR is 2nd highest daily volume but  has the 3rd lowest return.

**Summary**
---
Obviously not everyone is going to be running an i9 processor with 64GB of RAM. Refactoring makes it so we dont need to worry about this. Like i said before, my original code was atrocious and had multiple unnecessary steps. This will add seconds of time that add up ultimately and cause stress on your computer. Not only does this save us time but also reduces the chances of error.
